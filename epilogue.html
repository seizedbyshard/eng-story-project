                <p>The whisper solidified, becoming a faint, mournful hum that seemed to emanate from the very walls. Elias ascended the creaking stairs, each step a protest against the silence. Dust motes danced in the slivers of light filtering through grimy windows, illuminating a narrow hallway. At the end, a door stood ajar. He pushed it open to reveal a child's bedroom, frozen in time. A single, faded yellow dress lay draped over a small, wooden chair. The air was heavy, thick with a sorrow that wasn't his own. He reached for the dress, his fingers brushing the fabric, and a wave of memories, not his own, flooded his mind: laughter, tears, a child's fear, a desperate plea. He saw Sarah, not as a vanished sister, but as a terrified girl, trapped. The room began to spin, the walls blurring, and the metallic scraping sound returned, closer than ever, no longer outside, but within the very fabric of the house. Elias closed his eyes, and when he opened them, the fog was inside too, swirling, whispering, and he was no longer alone.</p>
