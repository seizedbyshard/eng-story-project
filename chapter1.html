                <p>The old sedan coughed, then died, its headlights swallowed by the impenetrable fog that had descended without warning. Elias gripped the steering wheel, his knuckles white, the silence outside pressing in, thick and suffocating. He’d driven for hours, chasing a phantom memory, a half-forgotten address from his estranged sister, Sarah, on a yellowed postcard. She’d vanished years ago, and this sudden, inexplicable urge had led him to this desolate road, Ashwood Creek.</p>
                <p>His phone was dead. He pushed open the door, the creak echoing unnaturally loud. The world outside was a canvas of gray, the trees mere suggestions. He began to walk, footsteps muffled, the fog swirling into indistinct shapes. He heard it then: a faint, metallic scraping sound, like something dragging itself across concrete, just beyond the veil.</p>
                <p>Through the mist, a rusted signpost emerged: "Ashwood Creek." The road narrowed, leading into a derelict town of skeletal, silent buildings. The scraping grew louder, closer, accompanied by a low, guttural moan. He stumbled into the town square.</p>
                <p>In the center, a tall, gaunt figure moved with an unnatural shuffle, dragging something heavy. Its head was a featureless, distorted mass, emanating the chilling moan. Elias froze. The creature turned its faceless head, tilting it slowly, sensing his presence. The scraping intensified, and Elias saw what it dragged: a mannequin, its plastic face contorted in a silent scream, dressed in a faded yellow dress. Sarah’s dress. Panic seized him. He turned and ran, blindly, back into the fog, the metallic drag and the guttural moan echoing behind him, growing closer with every frantic step.</p>
