                <p>The silence that followed his escape was almost as terrifying as the chase. It was a watchful, heavy silence, punctuated only by the frantic beat of his own heart. Elias stumbled through the fog-choked streets, each step uncertain. The buildings, once just derelict, now felt imbued with a sinister history. He passed a crumbling church, its steeple a broken finger pointing at the gray sky, then a general store, its windows boarded up, a faded "OPEN" sign hanging askew. He tried the door, but it was jammed, the wood swollen and rotten.</p>
                <p>A flicker of movement caught his eye in a darkened alleyway. He ducked behind a rusted dumpster, peering out. A childâ€™s toy, a red ball, rolled slowly out of the shadows, coming to rest at his feet. There was no wind. He stared at it, a cold dread creeping over him. He knew, instinctively, that he wasn't alone in this town. Not truly.</p>
                <p>Further on, he found a small, dilapidated house with a porch swing swaying gently, despite the lack of breeze. The front door hung ajar, revealing a glimpse of a dusty, cluttered interior. Hesitantly, he pushed it open. The air inside was stale, thick with the scent of decay and something else, something familiar. He stepped into a living room, furniture draped in white sheets like ghostly figures. On a small, overturned table, a photo album lay open. His breath hitched. It was Sarah. Younger, smiling, standing in front of this very house. And in the background, faintly visible, was the gnarled, ancient oak tree that marked the entrance to Ashwood Creek. A chilling realization dawned: Sarah hadn't just visited this town. She had lived here. And perhaps, she still did. A faint whisper, like a child's voice, seemed to drift from the floor above. "Elias...?"</p>
